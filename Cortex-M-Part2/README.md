# 🛸 Linux Creation
- **1980** : GNU project(free) with all OS components except kernel
- **1990** : Linux Kernel + GNU Project = Complete OS


# 🚦 Exception Level

- Usage Fault may happen during Execution by Cortex M4
- Final Loc of Fault/Interrupt Handler = Base Addr(VTOR) + Index of Usage Fault in Vector Table
- Here Bootloader development does not relies on Application & Application development does not relies on Bootloader
- Default value of **VTOR** is decided by **Boot ROM**
- Generally `VTOR-->0x0` } but is not always true

 Vector Table | 🍔 | 
--- | --- | 
Application Vector Table | VTOR-->X , Diff loc for usage fault | 
Bootloader Vector Table |  VTOR-->Y , Diff loc for usage fault |  

🍎 You generally place the VTOR at the place where you want to execute the code. 

Like for STM32, at the start of Flash memory

🍟 **ARM Core** look up vector table & read 2 words from vector table.
- PC --> sets to Reset Handler
- this PC address comes from Vector Table
- Till this point, whatever control flow the hardware has, now completed
- Now the control flow is in the hand of programmer
- All the computation / Applications run from the reset handler

Mode | 🍔 | 
--- | --- | 
Thread Mode | It is more restricted ( PSP - Process SP ) | 
Handler Mode | High Priority ( MSP - Main SP ) | 

### 🍭 Reset handler would be executing in thread mode


- We can set breakpoint into reset vector --> to check the status register of ARM
- VTOR will be set to some address by Designer/ BootRom writers
- As soon as, cpu is power up. 2 words will be fetched.



### 🚨 How CPU knows what to access?
- 32 bits CPU
- You can use 2^(32) combinations
- 4 GB of combinations out of 32 signals
- 🪂 **CPU Designer**
  - Whenever they want to have certain signals will be manipulated by users
  - They provide an interface called Registers

### 🌏 This example also called memory mapped IO
- Here Each interface is deciding based on the MSB value
- Memory is nothing but a signal trapped in Flip Flop
- 🏛 **ARM** comes up with the a Memory Map
  - If you respect this memory map then system will run smoothly
  - Designer should follow this map i.e should respect this map

### ⌛ Private Peripheral Bus
- **ARM RTL** would have NVIC, Systick, MPU, SCB
- **MPU** related to external device and external RAM
- SRAM = Read & Write Data Register
- 🛰 ARM specific Address
- 🚀 Vendor Specific Address (`Qualcomm, Broadcomm`)
-  **VTOR** : Vector Table Address Register

### 🔥 Handler 💧
- It is nothing but a function without any parameter & return value
- vendor will tell you which slots stands for which peripheral
- In VTOR table, size of each entry is 4B
- **31th IRQ** = `(16(fixed one)*4 + 31*4) + Base of VTOR`

### ⛱ Timers
- Timers --- generates IRQ --> NVIC --- Sends 31 th IRQ number---> CPU
- **CPU** 🌪
  - CPU might execute PSP (process SP)
  - will switch to MSP (main SP)
  - Then calculate the new address of the Timer Handler
  - Then Pushes the 8 register in MSP
  - Rest of the register will be taken by Handler
 
#### Return address & LR 🧶
- Return address is usefull for function inside a function
- [ MSP | PSP ]
-  r13(SP) : one of these

### 🔊 Reset Handler
- Reset loads the system to known state.
- It sets all the register and memory to a initial value
- This helps to ensure a **clean and predictable state** for the processor **to start from**
- Other exceptions, on the other hand may leave the process in an unknown state or corrupted condition
- Reset Handler sets the processor in Known state
- It executes in thead mode

### GCC 🐶
- It has its own **assembler (as)**, **linker (ld)** 
- It internally usage these tools
- 🕸 In application, main() is the the first function
- 🕸 In Embedded, first `start up` function calls the `main()` or any other funciton
- In abstraction, program has `.txt, .bss, .data` section in the memory
- 🍀 Special Note: **.S** has gone through Preprocessor and **.s** does not go through the preprocessing stage
- 🍉 **.o :** relocatable object file
- 🫐 linker : generates elf

### startup file 🥗
- sets bss section to 0
- `.bin `= .txt, .data, `.bss`
  - `.bss`: start up program only take start addr and size during startup time, we just initialize to 0
- **`.a`** : collections of .o files
- **KEEP(*(.vector))** 🫖
  - retain even if there is no reference to it in the program
- **logs of linker:** map file 🧊
  - when there is a crash in the system due to some address
  - take that address & check in map file which variable it is

### map file 🏥
- **&_stack_top** : this value is coming from .map file i.e after linking
- **vector table** : It is a collections of void pointers
```
// this is how we can add any function to a particular section
__attibute(used,.section(.text))
void foo(void){
    // some code
}
```
- **flash**: It is byte writeable ⛩
  - 1 --> 0  easy
  - 0 --> 1 expensible process
```
.bss(NOLOAD)
{
// It means don't load it during loading time
// reset handler will take care of it
}
```
```
.data
{
// some code
} > ram AT >flash
```
- 🧤 Initially, `.data` variables are available in **flash**
- 🔔 Later in the code, when we modify it, it will copy all `.data` to **ram** & modify their value

# 🇨🇦 🇦🇺 🇨🇳 🇮🇳 🇯🇵

### Reset to Main() 🎖🎖
- M-class cpu expects SP
- VTOR address is set by BootRom Program
- By SW means Intr & Code
#### What reset handler really do ? 🥊
- There are multiple section in the device that needs to be respected
- `.text, .data, .bss`
- `.data` has some critical value that needs to be stored during power cycle. Because it initialized value of some variables
- 1. Copy data from flash of .data section to ram .data section
  2. initialize .bss section to 0.
  3. By default value of uniniliazed variable do not have value 0, depends on the SRAM configuration  

### for example app.c running on Linux 🪖
- Loader has its own start up code which does exactly the same
- Very minimal initialization
- Then controller hand over the main()

### Renode 🎓
- Emulation platform

### **.vector** is the first section 🧢
- It is the first section in the flash also
- So `VTOR` will point to the first address of the flash nothing but `.vector` section
- Here in `.vector` section the first thing present in the **Vector Table**
- ```
  void (*const vectors[])(void)=
  {
      &_stack_top,
      reset_handler
  }
  ```
- **There cpu will fetch first 2 Words** 📯
- from `reset handler`, you will call the first function` may not be main()` 💎
