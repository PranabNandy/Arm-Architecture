## üéÉ  ARM = Advance RISC Machine

üç° RISC and CISC 
- Two different ideologies to design the ISA of process
- **ISA** : Agreement between software and Processor
  - It tells if software respect XYZ instruction, ABC operation will be performed by the processor
- RISC ---> MIPS/SPARC ---> came from partnership of IBM, Standford & Barkley

SW | üçî | 
--- | --- | 
ISA | Actual Contact | 
HW |        üíªüíªüíª  | 


**A** : 
- Phone, server, Laptop

**R** : 
- Realtime
- determinism
- GIC ( Trap Mechanism)

**M** : 
- Little application
- Interrupt driver
- Simple State machine
- Vecorted Interrupt

**Cortex-X** :
- It introdues from v9.0. Smart Phone, sensor

üéØ CISC : 
- Hardware breakdown the complexity
- So HW is complex

ü•ä RISC : 
- Complexity of the instruction has reduced.
- Compiler breakdown the complexity
- HW is simple
- Leads to low power usuage

ü•é No MMU, VA in Cortex R
  
üèâ **DSP/ SIMD** :
- Matrix Multiplication
- 1 32 bits register is performing operation for 8 bit each in 4 times.....
- 1 32 bits instr, carries 4 different info 8 bits each ( Single Instr but multiple data)

# Cortex-M (STM32F4XXXX) ü¶Ä

- It is not just a CPU üòà
- v7.0 + single Precision FPU
- **M4F** : FPU capable
- üí• NVIC : Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller
- üß† WIC : Wakeup Interrupt Controller
  - When CPU is in LPM, then it helps to wake up from the system if and only if new INT came to WIC block
- üê≥ ETM : Embedded Trace macro-sell
  - debug /trace instruction
- ü¶† JTAG : SWD ( Serial wire debugger in ARM)
- ü¶ã MPU : Divide the memory into multiple priviledges
- üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Systick : It is nothing but 24 bit Down Counter. RTOS needs timer based on that.
- **Enidans :** How we place LSB & MSB in Memory. ( Mostly we use little Endian)

üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cortex M should dominate MCU 8/ 16 bit
- To deal with **Thumb Instruction** ( `64 bit Core-->32 bit` Inst is Thumb, `32 bits---> 16/8 bit` inst is Thumb)
- Here we have to optimize the code density for the thumb instruction
- Even though it is not powerful as
  - no of instructions are limited
  - no of registers are  limited

üå∏ **Thumb2 Instr** = Thumb Inst + ARM Instr
  
üåº **M4** = dual IF stage == `(32 bits Instr --> 16 + 16 bits)`

Mode | üçî | 
--- | --- | 
Thread Mode | It is more restricted ( PSP - Process SP ) | 
Handler Mode | High Priority ( MSP - Main SP ) | 

**There is a Zero Register** which compare bit value of every registers.
